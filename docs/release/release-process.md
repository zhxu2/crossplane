# Release Process

This document is meant to be a complete end-to-end guide for how to release new versions of software
for Crossplane and its related projects.

## tl;dr Process Overview

All the details are available in the sections below, but we'll start this guide with a very high
level sequential overview for how to run the release process.

1. **feature freeze**: Merge all completed features into master branches of all repos to begin
   "feature freeze" period
1. **RC tag**: Run tag pipeline to tag the release candidate (RC) build in master for each repo
1. **branch**: Create a new release branch using the GitHub UI for each repo
1. **release stacks**: Run the release process for each **stack** that we maintain
    1. **test** Test builds from the release branch, fix any critical bugs that are found
    1. **version**: Update all version information in the docs, and integration
       tests in the release branch
    1. **tag**: Run the tag pipeline to tag the release branch with an official semver
    1. **build/publish**: Run build pipeline to publish build with official semver
1. **docs/examples**: In Crossplane's release branch, update all examples, docs, and integration
   tests to reference the new versions
1. **tag**: Run the tag pipeline to tag Crossplane's release branch with an official semver
1. **build/publish**: Run build pipeline to publish Crossplane build from release branch with
   official semver
1. **verify**: Verify all artifacts have been published successfully, perform sanity testing
1. **release notes**: Publish well authored and complete release notes on GitHub
1. **promote**: Run promote pipelines on all repos to promote releases to desired channel(s)
1. **announce**: Announce the release on Twitter, Slack, etc.

## Detailed Process

This section will walk through the release process in more fine grained and prescriptive detail.

### Scope

This document will cover the release process for all of the repositories that the Crossplane team
maintains and publishes regular versioned artifacts from. This set of repositories covers both core
Crossplane and the set of Stacks that Crossplane currently maintains:

* [`crossplane`](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane)
* [`provider-gcp`](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-gcp)
* [`provider-aws`](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-aws)
* [`provider-azure`](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-azure)
* [`provider-rook`](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-rook)


The release process for Stacks is almost identical to that of core Crossplane because they use the
same [shared build logic](https://github.com/upbound/build/).  The steps in this guide will apply to
all repositories listed above unless otherwise mentioned.

### Feature Freeze

Feature freeze should be performed on all repos.  In order to start the feature freeze period, the
following conditions should be met:

* All expected features should be ["complete"](#857) and merged into master. This includes user
  guides, examples, API documentation via [crossdocs](https://github.com/negz/crossdocs/), and test
  updates.
* All issues in the [milestone](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/milestones) should be
  closed
* Sanity testing has been performed on `master`

After these conditions are met, the feature freeze begins by creating the RC tag and the release
branch.

### Release Candidate (RC) Tag

The first step of feature freeze is to create the RC tag for the `HEAD` commit in `master`.  This
tag serves as an indication of when the release was branched from master and is also important for
generating future versions of `master` builds since that [versioning
process](https://github.com/upbound/build/blob/master/makelib/common.mk#L182-L196) is based on `git
describe --tags`.

> **NOTE:** The `tag` pipeline does not yet support extra tags in the version number, such as
`v0.5.0-rc`.  [#330](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/issues/330) will be resolved when
this functionality is available.  In the meantime, manually tagging and pushing to the repo
required.

To accomplish this, run the `tag` pipeline for each repo on the `master` branch.  You will be
prompted to enter the `version` for the tag and the `commit` hash to tag. It's possible to leave the
`commit` field blank to default to tagging `HEAD`. The `version` should be the release number that
we are branching for, plus a trailing tag to indicate it is an RC.  For example:

```console
v0.5.0-rc
```

After the tag pipeline has succeeded, verify in the [GitHub
UI](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/tags) that the tag was successfully applied to the
correct commit.

### Create Release Branch

Creating the release branch can be done within the [GitHub UI][github-ui-create-branch]. Basically,
you just use the branch selector drop down and type in the name of the new release branch, e.g.
`release-0.5`. Release branch names always follow the convention of `release-[minor-semver]`.

If this is the first ever release branch being created in a repo (uncommon), you should also set up
branch protection rules for the `release-*` pattern.  You can find existing examples in the
[Crossplane repo settings](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/settings/branches).

At this point, the `HEAD` commit in the release branch will be our release candidate.  The build
pipeline will automatically be started due to the create branch event, so we can start to perform
testing on this build.  Note that it should be the exact same as what is currently in `master` since
they are using the same commit and have the same tag.  Also note that this is not the official
release build since we have not made the official release tag yet (e.g. `v0.5.0`).

The `master` branch can now be opened for new features since we have a safe release branch to
continue bug fixes and improvements for the release itself.  Essentially, `master` is free to now
diverge from the release branch.

#### Bug Fixes in Release Branch

During our testing of the release candidate, we may find issues or bugs that we triage and decide we
want to fix before the release goes out. In order to fix a bug in the release branch, the following
process is recommended:

1. Make the bug fix into `master` first through the normal PR process
    1. If the applicable code has already been removed from `master` then simply fix the bug
       directly in the release branch by opening a PR directly against the release branch
1. Backport the fix by performing a cherry-pick of the fix's commit hash (**not** the merge commit)
   from `master` into the release branch.  For example, to backport a fix from master to `v0.5.0`,
   something like the following should be used:

    ```console
    git fetch --all
    git checkout -b release-0.5 upstream/release-0.5
    git cherry-pick -x <fix commit hash>
    ```

1. Open a PR with the cherry-pick commit targeting the release-branch

After all bugs have been fixed and backported to the release branch, we can move on to releasing the
stacks that the Crossplane community owns. Note that core Crossplane has still not been released
yet.

### Draft Release Notes

We're getting close to starting the official release, so you should take this opportunity to draft
up the release notes. You can create a [new release draft
here](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases/new).  Make sure you select "This is a
pre-release" and hit "Save draft" when you are ready to share and collect feedback.  Do **not** hit
"Publish release" yet.

You can see and follow the template and structure from [previous
releases](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases).

### Stack Release Process

At this point, we should have a release branch created in all repos with all issues resolved that
were triaged to be release blockers.  This section will walk through how to release the Stacks
themselves and does not directly apply to core Crossplane.

In the **release branch** for each Stack, you should update the version tag or metadata in:

* `integration_tests.sh` - `STACK_IMAGE`
* `*.resource.yaml` - docs links in markdown
  * Not all of these `*.resource.yaml` files have links that need to be updated, they are infrequent
    and inconsistent

### Stack Tag Pipeline

Now that the Stacks are all tested and their version metadata has been updated, it's time to tag the
release branch with the official version tag. You can do this by running the `tag` pipeline on the
release branch of each Stack:

* [`provider-gcp` tag
  pipeline](https://jenkinsci.upbound.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/crossplane%2Fprovider-gcp-pipelines%2Fprovider-gcp-tag/branches)
* [`provider-aws` tag
  pipeline](https://jenkinsci.upbound.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/crossplane%2Fprovider-aws-pipelines%2Fprovider-aws-tag/branches/)
* [`provider-azure` tag
  pipeline](https://jenkinsci.upbound.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/crossplane%2Fprovider-azure-pipelines%2Fprovider-azure-tag/branches/)
* [`provider-rook` tag
  pipeline](https://jenkinsci.upbound.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/crossplane%2Fprovider-rook-pipelines%2Fprovider-rook-tag/branches/)

Run the tag pipeline by clicking the Run button in the Jenkins UI in the correct release branch's
row. You will be prompted for the version you are tagging, e.g., `v0.5.0` as well as the commit
hash. The hash is optional and if you leave it blank it will default to `HEAD` of the branch, which
is what you want.

> **Note:** The first time you run a pipeline on a new branch, you won't get prompted for the values
> to input. The build will quickly fail and then you can run (not replay) it a second time to be
> prompted.  This is a Jenkins bug that is tracked by
> [#41929](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41929) and has been open for almost 3 years,
> so don't hold your breath.

After the tag pipeline has been run and the release branch has been tagged, you can run the normal
build pipeline on the release branch.  This will kick off the official release build and upon
success, all release artifacts will be officially published.

After the release build succeeds, verify that the correctly versioned Stack images have been pushed
to Docker Hub.

### Core Crossplane release

Back in the core Crossplane repository, we need to update the release branch docs and examples to
point to the freshly released stack versions.

* Documentation, such as [Installation
  instructions](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/docs/install-crossplane.md#installing-cloud-provider-stacks),
  and [Stack
  guides](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/docs/stacks-guide-gcp.md).
  * searching for `:master` will help a lot here
  * `kubectl -k` statements will contain `?ref=master`, which should be updated to the release
    branch name instead, e.g. `?ref=release-0.4`
* Examples, such as [`StackInstall` yaml
  files](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/tree/master/cluster/examples/providers)
* [Helm chart
  defaults](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/cluster/charts/crossplane/values.yaml.tmpl)
  for stack versions

### Tag Core Crossplane

Similar to running the `tag` pipelines for each stack, now it's time to run the [`tag`
pipeline](https://jenkinsci.upbound.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/crossplane%2Fcrossplane%2Fcrossplane-tag/branches)
for core Crossplane.  In fact, the [instructions](#stack-tag-pipeline) are exactly the same:

* Run the `tag` pipeline on the release branch
* Enter the version and commit hash (leave blank for `HEAD`)
* The first time you run on a new release branch, you won't be prompted and the build will fail,
  just run (not replay) a second time

### Build and Release Core Crossplane

After tagging is complete, ensure the [normal build
pipeline](https://jenkinsci.upbound.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/crossplane%2Fcrossplane%2Fbuild/branches)
is run on the release branch.  This will be the official release build with an official version
number and all of its release artifacts will be published.

After the pipeline runs successfully, you should verify that all artifacts have been published to:

* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crossplane/crossplane)
* [S3 releases bucket](https://releases.crossplane.io/)
* [Helm chart repository](https://charts.crossplane.io/)
* [Docs website](https://crossplane.io/docs/latest)

### Promotion

If everything looks good with the official versioned release that we just published, we can go ahead
and run the `promote` pipeline for all repos. This is a very quick pipeline that doesn't rebuild
anything, it simply makes metadata changes to the published release to also include the last release
in the channel of your choice. Currently, we only support the `alpha` channel.

For each repo, run the `promote` pipeline on the release branch and input the version you would like
to promote (e.g. `v0.5.0`) and the channel you'd like to promote it to (e.g. `alpha`).  The first
time you run this pipeline on a new release branch, you will not be prompted for values, so the
pipeline will fail.  Just run (not replay) it a second time to be prompted.

After the `promote` pipeline has succeeded, verify on DockerHub and the Helm chart repository that
the release has been promoted to the right channel.

### Publish Release Notes

Now that the release has been published and verified, you can publish the [release
notes](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases) that you drafted earlier. After
incorporating all feedback, you can now click on the "Publish release" button.

This will send an email notification with the release notes to all watchers of the repo.

### Announce Release

We have completed the entire release, so it's now time to announce it to the world.  Using the
[@crossplane_io](https://twitter.com/crossplane_io) Twitter account, tweet about the new release and
blog.  You'll see examples from the previous releases, such as this tweet for
[v0.4](https://twitter.com/crossplane_io/status/1189307636350705664).

Post a link to this tweet on the Slack #announcements channel, then copy a link to that and post it
in the #general channel.

### Patch Releases

We also have the ability to run patch releases to update previous releases that have already been
published.  These patch releases are always run from the last release branch, we do **not** create a
new release branch for a patch release.

The basic flow is **very** similar to a normal release, but with a few less steps.  Please refer to
details for each step in the sections above.

* Fix any bugs in `master` first and then `cherry-pick -x` to the release branch
  * If `master` has already removed the relevant code then make your fix directly in the release
    branch
* After all testing on the release branch look good and any docs/examples/tests have been updated
  with the new version number, run the `tag` pipeline on the release branch with the new patch
  version (e.g. `v0.5.1`)
* Run the normal build pipeline on the release branch to build and publish the release
* Publish release notes
* Run promote pipeline to promote the patch release to the `alpha` channel
